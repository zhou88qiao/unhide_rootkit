**********************

BUG FIXES
  - include <stdarg.h> in unhide-output.h, some old gcc/glibc need it.

SUPPORT FOR PORTING
  - On non Linux OS, ss is not used by default by unhide-tcp.
    This way, FreeBSD guys should be able to package without patching unhide source :)
  - On FreeBSD, use sockstat instead of fuser.

MISCELLANOUS

  - The unhide files in the tarball are again contained in a directory (unhide-YYYYMMDD)
  - The name of the tarball uses again a '-' not a '_'.
  - Help packagers: in unhide-posix.c, unhide-output.c, unhide-tcp.c, OS specific
    command are put between #ifdef instead of beeing commented.
  - Correct banner of unhide-posix.
  - Update manpages.
  - Add build/use require list in readme files

**********************

IMPORTANT

  - unhide-linux26.c was renamed to unhide-linux.c
  - unhide.c was renamed to unhide-posix.c
  - The log file of unhide-linux is renamed 'unhide-linux_AAAA-MM-DD.log'
  - The log file of unhide-tcp is named 'unhide-tcp_AAAA-MM-DD.log'
  - By default, unhide-tcp now use /sbin/ss from iproute2 package, to use
    netstat as before '-n' option must be given on command line.
  - Display is more verbose and multi-lines for hidden processes (unhide-linux).
  - If asked to (-l and/or -f), display is more verbose and multi-lines for hidden ports (unhide-tcp).
  - sysinfo test is no more called as part of compound quick and sys tests as it may give false positives.
    It could still be run using the checksysinfo, checksysinfo2 or checksysinfo3 command line parameter.

NEW FEATURES

  - Major enhancement of unhide-tcp :
     * Add capability to output a log file (unhide-tcp_AAA-MM-DD.log)
     * Add capability to output more information (via lsof and/or fuser) on hidden port if available
     * Add verbose mode (disabled by default) to display warning
     * Add a new method (via option '-s') very fast on system with huge number of opened ports
     * Make a double check of port access to avoid false positive (previous single check
       version is available as unhide-tcp-simple-check.c if needed).
  - Add a quick port in C language of unhide.rb (unhide_rb.c) and guess what ...
    it's 40 times faster than original ruby unhide.rb
    unhide_rb doesn't take any option.
  - Add "-d" option for doing a double check in brute test, this reduce false positives.
  - Add "-o" option as synonym of "-f".
  - For found hidden processes, display the user and the working directory
    as extracted from the process environment. Note that it doesn't work well 
    for kernel processes/threads nor for deamons.
  - For found hidden processes, display cmdline, exe link and internal command name.

MISCELLANOUS

  - Add french and spanish man page for unhide-tcp
  - Update english manpage of unhide-tcp to reflect changes
  - Minor corrections in french manpage of unhide
  - Display copyright and license information in start banners.
  - Make message from sysinfo tests more clear.
  - Add a NEWS file :)
  - Update README.txt, LISEZ-MOI.txt and LEEME.txt to clarify difference between
    unhide-posix and unhide-linux.
  - Remove sysinfo test from quick and sys compound tests as it may give false positive.
    sysinfo test still can be used via the checksysinfo[2|3] command line parameters.

BUG FIXES

  - Suppress pedantic compilation warnings (glibc >=2.3, gcc >=4.6).
  - Correct the number of processes displayed for /proc counting in sysinfo test.

**********************

NEW FEATURES

  - Add spanish man page
  - Add additional check to checkopendir when -m is specified.
  - Add a option (-f) to create a log file.
  - Add checkopendir test (also called by procfs and procall compound test)
  - Also do opendir() test in reverse and quick tests.
  - Add alternate sysinfo test (via -r option or checksysinfo2 test name)
  - Make the output of hidden process on one line to facilitate parsing
  - Display wchan if there is no cmdline and no exe link (sleeping kernel threads)
  - Add -V version to show version and exit.
  - The -v option can now be given more than once on command line : management of several verbosity level.
  - Now several tests can be simultaneously entered on the command line.
  - Add all elementary tests to the command line test list
  - Add procall compound test command line args.
  - Check for our own spawn ps process in reverse test to avoid false positive.
  - Enhanced fake process detection in reverse test.

BUG FIXES

  - Correct warning message in additional check of checkchdir.
  - Close log file only if it is open.
  - Correct the value returned by unhide
  - Add the misssing new lines in most of the warnings (thanks to gordy for the report).
  - Check the return of fgets in checkallreverse(), check of feof seems not to be
     very reliable for a pipe, we sometime got the last line 2 times (thanks to gordy for the report).
  - Correct an initialized fd use, that gcc don't report when -O2 isn't given on command line

DEVELOPER ISSUES

  - Minor readability when generating program info for display
  - Factorize (f)printf to stdout & log.
  - Add a preliminary testsuite for unhide (sanity.sh)
  - Use printbadpid() in checkallnoprocps() as in other tests.
  - Also check it in checksysinfo & checksysinfo2
  - Simplify and clarify test checksysinfo()
  - Redo args parsing : Manage multiple args on command line and several verbosity levels.
  - Add a tests table to allow new command line parsing.
  - Correct a copy/past "typo", in checkps
  - Minor optimizations of printf & sprintf calls.

MISCELLANOUS

  - Add a NEWS file
  - Add GPL disclaimer to source files
  - Add french LISEZ-MOI.txt file
  - Add reference to new unhide site in version string
  - Add a warning about the generic version of unhide in README.txt (thanks to gordy for the report)
  - Modify man page to add the -V option, correct typos and clarify quick test.
  - Add -O2 option to compiling command line in README.txt
  - Add a TODO file
