[TODO]
- Integrate -m in other test,
- Try to factorize the code,
- More optimizations,
- Add a mail sending option,
- Beautify the source (add comments, function headers, etc.),
- Add a version number beside date of release,
- Localize (have you already used gettext ?), create man pages in other language
- Add an install script or use autotools/cmake/something else.
- Upgrade the generic version of unhide with some of the enhancements of the
  linux26 version.
- Others ...


[DONE]
- Make a meta proc test that involves all /proc test (proc and procfs)
- Add more verbosity level,
- Sanitize the exit code,
- Make a better command line parsing (without getopt:),
- Put it in a CVS/SVN/Git repo, unhide is on sourceforge.
- Create a TODO file :), you're reading it
- Add an option (-x for expert ?) which allows to run subtest individually.
   Done without the use of a special option
- Add a option (-f ) to create a log file, (not everybody use unhide via RKH)
- Add a test script to reliably test new version (preliminary version).
